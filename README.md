# BirdBox
BirdBox is a sound-spatial multi-participant cross-platform experience that bridges AR and VR environments. 
The prototype lives in two branches at the moment: RunzeBranch is the AR app, BirdBoxVR is the VR app. 
We'd like to try to merge these into one code base for both versions, we'll see if we can or even want
to do that, however, for now, to build the AR side, build the RunzeBranch and for the VR side, the BirdBoxVR
branch.
